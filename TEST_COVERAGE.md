   - Independent event handling
   - Responsive design consistency
   - Animation integration
   - Content consistency across sections

### Test Infrastructure
7. **test-setup.ts** - Global test configuration
   - Mock window APIs (open, location, matchMedia)
   - DOM API mocks
   - Prefers-reduced-motion support

8. **test-utils.tsx** - Testing utilities
   - Custom render function
   - Mock data generators
   - Helper functions for common test scenarios

9. **bun.config.test.ts** - Bun test configuration
   - Happy DOM environment
   - Coverage thresholds and reporting
   - Test file patterns and exclusions

## Test Categories Covered

### Functional Testing
- ✅ User interactions (clicking, form submission)
- ✅ State management (tab switching, active states)
- ✅ External integrations (email, URLs)
- ✅ Data rendering from imported sources
- ✅ Navigation and routing

### Accessibility Testing
- ✅ ARIA labels and roles
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Screen reader compatibility
- ✅ Reduced motion preferences
- ✅ Focus management

### Visual Testing
- ✅ CSS class application
- ✅ Responsive design breakpoints
- ✅ Animation presence and staggering
- ✅ Color scheme consistency
- ✅ Layout structure integrity

### Error Handling
- ✅ Missing callback props
- ✅ External service failures
- ✅ Invalid data handling
- ✅ Network connectivity issues

## Key Testing Patterns

### Behavior-First Testing
Tests focus on user behavior rather than implementation details:
```typescript
test("clicking Technical tab switches content", () => {
  render(<SupportSection />);
  const technicalTab = screen.getByRole("button", { name: /technical/i });
  fireEvent.click(technicalTab);
  expect(screen.getByRole("heading", { name: /technical support/i })).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Accessibility-First Approach
Tests verify accessibility compliance:
```typescript
test("QR code has proper accessibility", () => {
  render(<DownloadSection />);
  const qrImage = screen.getByAltText("QR Code to download Mova app from App Store");
  expect(qrImage).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

### Performance Considerations
Tests ensure animations use GPU-accelerated properties:
```typescript
test("particles use GPU-accelerated properties only", () => {
  render(<HeroSection />);
  const particles = document.querySelectorAll('[class*="animate-particle"]');
  particles.forEach(particle => {
    expect(particle).toHaveClass("absolute");
    expect(particle).toHaveClass("rounded-full");
  });
});
```

## Mocking Strategy

### External Dependencies
- **Lucide React Icons**: Mocked with testid-enabled components
- **Image Imports**: Mocked with placeholder paths
- **Window APIs**: Comprehensive mocking for browser APIs
- **Data Imports**: Mocked with test fixtures

### Component Libraries
UI components are imported and tested as-is to verify real integration behavior.

## Coverage Goals

### Target Coverage
- **Lines**: 85%+
- **Functions**: 80%+
- **Branches**: 75%+
- **Statements**: 85%+

### Critical Paths Prioritized
1. User interaction flows (tab switching, downloads)
2. External integrations (email, URLs)
3. Accessibility features
4. Responsive behavior
5. Animation systems

## Running Tests

### Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Watch mode
bun test:watch

# Coverage report
bun test:coverage

# CI mode
bun test:ci
```

### Prerequisites
Dependencies in package.json:
- `@testing-library/react`: React testing utilities
- `@testing-library/jest-dom`: Custom jest matchers
- `@testing-library/user-event`: User interaction simulation
